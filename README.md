# Prison-Escape-
A small text-based adventure game with branching story lines and player-decided outcomes.
 This game should take you about a minute to win it!
 This game was made as part of a Udemy course I pursued on my own time to teach myself Unity development.
I intend to make more changes to this game, and make it longer. 

NPTE: you will need a keyboard with a dedicated number pad to play this game.
